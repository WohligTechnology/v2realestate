                                <p>V2 Real Estate Private Limited has the experience in providing prime real estate on lease to some of the world's most respected corporate entities. We offer a complete range of Commercial Office Leases across Mumbai and various cities in India. </p>

                                    V2 Real Estate is involved in all of the following types of Office leasing </p>
                                <p><span class="bold">SHELL: </span> A typical Un Furnished office (also referred to as "Bare Shell Premises") means a basic floor plate without any civil works or flooring of any nature. One has to design this from scratch and plan electrical cabling, flooring and in a few cases even positioning of toilet blocks and Air Handling Unit (AHU) rooms can be changed.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="bold">  WARM SHELL:</span> Warm Shell Office space is where V2 Real Estate does the basic civil works of the premises such as Flooring, False Ceiling and Rest Rooms. In some cases Air Conditioning and Light Fittings are also provided.</p>
                                <p>This is a solution that is reached when a Company can commit to a Lock-in period and needs a furnished premises. This way the Company's cost of furnishing is substantially reduced as well as the Interests of V2 Real Estate are taken care of as the Lessee is not investing in something which would be obsolete after the Lessee has moved out of the premises.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <p><span class="bold"> FULLY FURNISHED OFFICES:</span> Fully Furnished offices (also referred to as "Plug-N-Play Offices" or "Ready to Move in Offices"), as the name suggests, are ready to move-in offices, fully equipped for a Lessee to begin operations. Fully Furnished Offices are equipped with Flooring and Carpeting, False Ceiling, Light Fittings, Air Conditioning (Central or Splits), Reception Area, Conference Room(s), Executive Cabin(s), Workstations or Cubicles, LAN connectivity, WIFI ready, CCTV ready, Computerised Access System, Tables and Chairs as required, Pantry and Rest Rooms, etc.</p>

                                    <p><span class="bold">  1.) Ready Furnished Offices:</span> Generally these are offices which are sought after for an immediate start-up. Finding a Ready Furnished Office which exactly matches your requirement can be very gruesome task, thus, our clients rely on expertise of V2 Real Estate.</p>
                                    <p> There are many advantages which these type of offices offer. First and most important being that one can virtually start their operations the next morning. Another factor is the cost as these type of offices are a bit cheaper taking into account the time lapse for furnishing the office is ZERO, in ready furnished offices. The only disadvantage is that there is less flexibility in terms of Layout of the Office and Lessee has to accept the colour &amp; style of furniture.</p>


                                    <p><span class="bold">      2.) Tailor Made Offices: </span>These type of Offices are furnished from scratch by the V2 Real Estate as per the Layouts and Design approved by the Lessee. Companies with specific requirements opt for these type of Offices. The cost of these Offices is a bit higher than the un-furnished office rates. It takes between 90 to 120 days for the premises to be in a ready to move in condition.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The advantage in these type of offices is that one can carefully plan the layout and design of the Office as per specific requirements of the Lessee. The choice of colour combinations of the office and furniture and quality of furniture can be decided by the Lessee Company.</p>
                                    <p>
                                        The most important issue here is the Lock-in Period. A Lock-in Period is the time frame within which the Licensee cannot terminate the Agreement. A minimum of 60 months Lock-in has to be given. Therefore the scope of further expansion has to be considered while zeroing in on this type of Office.</p>
